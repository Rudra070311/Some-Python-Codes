# Number Guessing Game
#This is a simple Python program where the computer guesses a number you are thinking of between 0 and 100 using binary search.


print("Please Think Of A Secret Number Between 0 and 100!!")
low = 0
high = 100
ans = int((high + low)/2)

while ans < 100 and ans > 0:
    ans = int((high + low)/2)
    an = print('Is your answer', ans,  '?')
    nex = input("Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly.")
    if nex == "c":
        print("Game over. Your secret number was: ",  ans)
        break
    elif nex == "h":
        high = ans
    elif nex == "l":
        low = ans
    else:
        print("Sorry, I did not understand your input.")
